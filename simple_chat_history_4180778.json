I can't make external API calls or access external services.\n\nI can, however, help you work with the telegram-qwen project that's available in your current directory. This project appears to be a bridge between Telegram and another service, and I can assist with:\n\n- Examining the current bridge implementation\n- Modifying configuration settings\n- Understanding how the bridge works\n- Updating the code to meet your needs\n- Working with the documentation\n\nWould you like me to help with any aspect of the telegram-qwen project instead? I can start by exploring the code structure to better understand how it works."
